          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
            I am a BCA graduate with a deep passion for technology and
            computers. My journey in the tech world began in 2018 when I started
            building desktops and repairing hardware. As I delved deeper into
            the world of IT, my interests expanded beyond hardware. During the
            COVID-19 pandemic, I entered the IT industry and began exploring the
            world of DevOps and cloud computing, where I discovered a natural
            affinity for it. I recently completed my DevOps Cloud Engineer
            Certification at GUVI from March 2024 to July 2024.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
            Fascinated by the intersection of development and operations, I have
            dedicated myself to mastering the skills necessary to succeed as a
            DevOps Cloud Engineer. With experience in building and deploying
            CI/CD pipelines, as well as automating cloud infrastructure, I
            specialize in creating efficient and scalable solutions that support
            seamless software delivery.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
            I am proficient in modern DevOps tools and cloud platforms, with
            hands-on experience in AWS. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and
            am driven by a desire to streamline processes and enhance
            collaboration within development teams. I am eager to join a
            forward-thinking organization where I can continue growing and
            contribute to innovative cloud-basedÂ projects.
